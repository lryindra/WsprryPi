Issue #1
Add #include <sys/sysmacros.h> in mailbox.c before #include <sys/mman.h>

suggest adding -Wno-psabi to CXXFLAGS in project's makefile

Issue #2:
We did some troubleshooting after trying to run WsprryPi on a Raspberry Pi 4.
Two issues:
makefile does not correctly identify the Pi version
Both the Pi3B and Pi4 identified the same ARMV7l
No configuration for PI4 clock changes and base address.
makefile I used needs to be edited to properly set PI-VERSION
The RPi 4 requires 2 changes in gpioclk
#define BCM2708_PERI_BASE 0xfe000000
#define F_PLLD_CLK (750000000.0)
This meant adding RPI4 option in the 'makefile' and changes to use this new setting in both gpioclk.cpp and wspr.cpp.
